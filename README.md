# Traffic-Sign-Detection
This project was developed during my efforts to self-learn Python. This repository is based on Chapter 6 of [Modern Computer Vision with Pytorch]. Traffic Sign Detetion is a commmon problem in image classification. The dataset used can be found in the following [link]. A csv file(train.csv) was created using the CSV Creator.py containing the following columns: Filepath,Sign Name,5 Digit Int Label,1 Digit Int Label.
